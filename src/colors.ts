/**
 * Every colour the app is allowed to use. The names match the design file's
 * tokens (mh.css), so a value can be traced from an artboard to this file
 * without a translation step.
 *
 * Light only today. Dark is planned: add a `dark` key with the same shape and
 * teach `useTheme()` to choose between them. Every screen already reads colour
 * through that hook, so nothing else has to change.
 *
 * The design file nests the status colours (`match: { bg, fg }`). They are flat
 * here so `ThemeColor` stays a union of colour names and `theme[name]` is
 * always a colour, never an object.
